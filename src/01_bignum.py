# Print out 2 to the 65536 power
# (try doing the same thing in the JS console and see what it outputs)

## JavaScript
# 2**65536 returns Infinity

## Understand
# Print (means use the print() function) 2 to the 65536th power

## Plan 
# Research how to do exponential operators in Python
# It is the same way in JS as it is in Py

## Execute
print(2**65536)

## Reflect
# It works! Is there a faster/better way?
